# ðŸ«€ Cardiovascular Disease Prediction - Data Science Project

This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) using a range of patient health metrics. The dataset includes features like age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, BMI, and lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, physical activity).


## ðŸ§  Techniques Used

- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
- Feature importance (Random Forest, correlation heatmaps)
- Model training and evaluation:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - XGBoost
- Performance metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision / Recall / F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve & AUC

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

The best-performing model achieved high accuracy and recall, making it suitable for early identification of at-risk individuals. Model interpretability and class imbalance handling were key focus areas.
